DOORMAN
=======

Doorman is an http proxy that authenticates via OAuth.

Your organization probably has some internal services that need to be
password-protected.  You likely also already manage users using an external
service. (Github, Google Apps, etc)  Wouldn't it be nice if you could
delegate your internal app's authentication/authorization to that app?

Requirements
------------

 * node.js >= 0.4.x


Installation
------------

  * `npm install`
  * copy conf.example.js to your config name, eg jenkins
  * configurate your config-file with keys
  * copy and edit doorman_example.config to your /etc/init for autostart


Strategies
----------

Doorman uses [everyauth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth) for authenticating,
so it supports a wide variety of providers for authentication.  For authorization,
we need to determine which authenticated users to let in. (see `lib/modules`) So
far only the Github module is complete, but others are fairly easy.


Acknowledgements
----------------

Doorman is pretty much just everyauth (https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth) and
node-http-proxy (https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy) grafted together,
and those two projects do most of the heavy lifting.
